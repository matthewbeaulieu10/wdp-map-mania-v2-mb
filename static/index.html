        Welcome to Matthew Beaulieu's implementation of Map Mania
    </h1>
    <p>
        I'm glad you decided to join me! Here's the gist of the game: 
        you have to find each of my ten favorite locations. How you do that
        is zooming in close enough (zoom level 10) to each of the spots
        that I have selected. The spot must be visible within the window
        within zoom level 10 for you to receive credit. Once there are zero
        spots left to win, the game is over! If you want to be really lame, 
        I've posted a cheat button on the next page for you to go and take 
        the easy way out, although I strongly discourage it.
    </p>
